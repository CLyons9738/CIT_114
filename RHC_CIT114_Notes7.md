### Definitions

* The World Wide Web is a subset of the internet; Websites. Written in HTML
* Url means Uniform Resource Identifier basically the address of a website/page
* Ip addresses are numbers that make up devices on a network and devices communicate with them.
### The OSI(7-layer) Sending or receiving data
* **Layer Seven, Application Layer** Where applications can use network services
* **Layer Six, Presentation Layer** Encrypts the data and makes sure the format is readable
* **Layer Five, Session Layer** 

### IP addresses and DNS 
* All devices have a unique address.
Traditional Ip addresses are 32 bits long. Each section is 8 bits.
IPv6 uses 128 bits and its being used now because we need a longer Internet address.
DNS services are divided into heiarchy and they bounce information off of eachother and help eachother out.
DNS was originally created to be open communication protocol. Because of this its very vulnurable to cyber attacks. 
DNS Spoofing is when a hacker changes the DNS server and changes it to match a domain name with the wrong IP address.  
### Basics of binary math
* A byte-Eight bits
**What is Binary 00000010 in decimal?**
128   64     32   16   8    4    2   1
0     0      0    0    0    0    1   0 = 2 decimal 


**Decimal to binary conversion**
* What is decimal 154 in binary? = 10011010
128 64  32 16  8  4  2  1 
1   0   0  1   1  0  1  0
